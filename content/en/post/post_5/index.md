## Рабочая неделя

## Work week

This week has been boring!!! Nothing interesting happened:( 

I went dancing on Wednesday. We danced "deja vu" - txt. At first I didn't really like this choreography, but then I really liked it!

On Thursday, at the matanalysis, we started going through double integrals and I was very happy, because of all mathematics, I love integrals! I can't even find the words how much I love integrals!!!

## P.S.

There was a very strong wind and rain on Friday. I don't like this weather(
The sun would be better!
