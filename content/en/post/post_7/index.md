Programming is constantly evolving, and with it the programming languages that developers use. To be successful in the IT world, it is important to choose an up-to-date and in-demand programming language to study.

## Programming languages

### Python

Python is a general purpose programming language with a simple syntax, which makes it ideal for beginners. It is in demand in the development of web applications, scientific research, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Thanks to the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, Python continues to hold its position as a leader.

### JavaScript

TypeScript is an add—on to JavaScript developed by Microsoft to improve static typing and code scalability. TypeScript allows you to detect errors at the stage of writing code, which improves the quality and reliability of applications being developed. Integration with popular frameworks makes TypeScript a sought‑after language among web developers.

### Ruby
